SC1. You have just finished three months of ethnographic field work on religion and women's rights activism in Dubai. You're headed home with the data you've collected, which is currently stored on your laptop. Your flight leaves for Berlin tomorrow morning, and from there you'll head to the United States.

Discuss the scenario above, then...

**Attacker:** Make a list of the potential fail points, both active and passive, as well as any legal and/or ethical concerns that might contribute to those fail points. Assume potential action from hostile parties. You are encouraged to review concepts in this class and do online sleuthing to find ways that the data might be vulnerable.

**Defender:** Come up with a way to harden the scenario against the threats you discussed, then draft a plan to protect your assets. Make it clear, specific, and comprehensive. While you should imagine ways to harden the scenario, and can thus add things as you see fit (additional preparation, necessary equipment, etc.), you must nevertheless keep in mind the limitations implied by the situation.
