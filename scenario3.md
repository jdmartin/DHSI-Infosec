SC3. You are a marine researcher in the Florida Keys. NOAA is tracking a large, category-five hurricane that has a 50% chance of making landfall 30 miles from your research station. Your data is backed up to a high redundancy RAID device on the center's network.

Discuss the scenario above, then...

**Attacker:** Make a list of the potential fail points, both active and passive, as well as any legal and/or ethical concerns that might contribute to those fail points. Assume potential action from hostile parties. You are encouraged to review concepts in this class and do online sleuthing to find ways that the data might be vulnerable.

**Defender:** Come up with a way to harden the scenario against the threats you discussed, then draft a plan to protect your assets. Make it clear, specific, and comprehensive. While you should imagine ways to harden the scenario, and can thus add things as you see fit (additional preparation, necessary equipment, etc.), you must nevertheless keep in mind the limitations implied by the situation.
