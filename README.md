## Welcome to Information Security for Digital Researchers!

This webpage contains a collection of resources, divided by topic, that
will be useful both as background and as course material. You don't have to browse them all, and you don't have to absorb everything. This is just context.
I've tried to arrange them in as helpful a manner as I can, but hope that you will
reach out with any questions or concerns.

And with that... let's get started.
